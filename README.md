This assignment was meant to help us grasp using mysql databases. If I had started this project earlier I would have added the bonuses. I'm really enjoying mysql and feel I am grasping it well. I didn't run into a ton of issues while completing the assignment. Just remembering to update my schema and seed as I made changes to them in the mysql editor.
